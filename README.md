# EV Energy Management & Efficiency Optimization System

## Overview
This project implements a software-based energy management system for electric vehicles. It models vehicle energy consumption, analyzes driving efficiency, and applies SOC-based optimization logic to improve overall energy efficiency.

## Features
- Physics-based energy consumption model
- City vs highway efficiency analysis (Wh/km)
- Battery State of Charge (SOC) tracking
- SOC-based eco-mode and energy optimization logic
- Modular and extensible software architecture

## System Architecture
Vehicle Model → Energy Model → Battery SOC → Eco-Mode Logic → Driver/System Recommendations

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
python main.py
